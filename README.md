## ðŸ“¡ WiFi Module with ESP-AT

Flash the ESP-AT firmware to your module using the official guide:  
ðŸ‘‰ [ESP-AT Firmware Documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-at/en/latest/esp32c3/)

Supported modules include:
- ESP8266  
- ESP32  
- ESP32-C2, ESP8684  
- ESP32-C3  
- ESP32-C6  
- ESP32-S2

Once the firmware is flashed, connect the module to the configured UART pins on the Pico.

To send AT commands via Pico's serial interface, use the `@` symbol as a prefix. Note that the ESP-AT module will not respond unless a host microcontroller is sending commands properly.

### ðŸ“˜ ESP-AT Command Format

```bash
@ <your AT command>
@ AT          # Check connection/status
@ AT+GMR      # Check firmware version
@ AT+CWMODE?  # Query current WiFi mode
